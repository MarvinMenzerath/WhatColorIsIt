# What Color Is It
Did you ever wanted to know what the current time would look like? Good news: now you can!  
Just click [**here**](https://marvinmenzerath.github.io/WhatColorIsIt/) and watch how time changes colors!

Explore new and unseen colors, check the time and have a unique screensaver!

## How does this magical thing work?
I'm glad you asked. The color-generating-process is very interesting, but also hard to understand.

Here is an example:
```
Time:    13:37:59
Color: # 13 37 59
```

And here in general:
```
Time:    HH:MM:SS
Color: # HH MM SS
```

Oh, and this one may be even easier to understand:
```
Color = '#' + (Time - ':')
```

And if you are interested in the code, then have a look at [this](https://github.com/MarvinMenzerath/WhatColorIsIt/blob/gh-pages/assets/script.js) JavaScript.
